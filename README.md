___
**DXSpider** is a great DX Cluster software that has useful telnet interface. 
I wrote this application in order to add a web user interface to DXSpider and show the spots collected.
The user could see 50 spots at time and filter them by band, spotter continent and spotted continent.

**NOTE:**   starting from the version 2.5.8 it will works only from Dxspider version V1.57 build 560 or greater.

For this application, I've used:
- **Bootstrap** for stylesheet CSS
- **Apache ECharts** for managing charts
- **qrz.com** For each callsing, found you can click on lens and you'll see him on qrz.com
- **flag-icon-css** [https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css) I used it to show the country flags 
- **ng3k.com** [ng3k.com](http://ng3k.com/misc/adxo.html) I used to get information about "Announced Dx Operations". Thanks to Bill/NG3K !!!
- **silso** [sidc.be/silso](https://sidc.be/silso/) used to show propagation trend in "Chart & stats" section
- **hamqsl** [www.hamqsl.com/solar.html](https://www.hamqsl.com/solar.html/) used to show solar and band conditions
- **kc2g** [prop.kc2g.com](https://prop.kc2g.com/) used to show MUF map

### Changelog
see file ["CHANGELOG.md"](docs/CHANGELOG.md)

### Install            

**1) DXSpider**
First of all you have to installed [DXspider](http://www.dxcluster.org/) and connected with some other cluster nodes.

**2) MariaDB / MySQL**
Then you have to install MariaDB on your web server, on the same server where DXSpider is running and configure DXSpider to use it: in your spider folder edit `local/DXVars.pm` adding these lines:
```DXWars.pm
# the SQL database DBI dsn
$dsn = "dbi:mysql:dxcluster:localhost:3306";
$dbuser = "your-user";
$dbpass = "your-password"; 
```
If you would change some MariaDB parameters, then you can find them in  `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` or `/etc/my.cnf`, depending on your distro.
If the database will not be created automatically, please see ["DB_ISSUES.md"](docs/DB_ISSUES.md) 

Is it possible that have also to install mariadb libraries. For Ubuntu:

```console
 foo@bar:~$ sudo apt-get install -y libmariadb-dev             
```


**3) Python modules**  
You could install python modules using automatic or manual way.

*3.1) Automatic modules install*  
after downloaded spiderweb move in the main folder and install using requirements.txt file
```console
 foo@bar:~$ cd spiderweb                                
 foo@bar:~$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*3.2) Manual modules install*  
First of all you have to install the python3 pip installer
```console
foo@bar:~$ sudo apt install python3-pip
```
This application is based on Flask 
To install **Flask**:
```console
foo@bar:~$ pip install flask 
foo@bar:~$ pip install Flask-minify
foo@bar:~$ pip install flask_wtf
foo@bar:~$ pip install pandas
```

*3.3) Optional: Utility for band and mode management (dx2sp\_bands-modes.py)*

If you would reconfigure your band.json and mode.json basing on your DXSpider frequencie, you can use this utility, otherwhise you can use the standard "factory" frequencies.

A Python utility (`dx2sp_bands-modes.py`) in scripts folders is available to convert amateur radio band and mode data from a Dxspider configuration file to the JSON format used by Spiderweb (`bands.json` and `modes.json`).

**Warning:** Using this utility will overwrite the existing `bands.json` and `modes.json` files. Before proceeding, a backup copy of the original files will be created.

To run the utility:

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  Save the `dx2sp_bands-modes.py` file in the main Spiderweb directory.
3.  Open a terminal in the main Spiderweb directory.
4.  Execute the command:
    ```console
    python3 dx2sp_bands-modes.py
    ```
5.  Follow the on-screen instructions, entering the full path to your Dxspider `bands.pl` file (for example, `/home/sysop/spider/data/bands.pl`).

The utility will perform the following operations:

  * Reads the Dxspider `bands.pl` file.
  * Extracts band and mode information.
  * Converts it to the JSON format used by Spiderweb.
  * Saves the converted data to the `cfg/bands.json` and `cfg/modes.json` files, creating a backup of the existing files first.
  * Generates a report on the conversion process, indicating any unconverted bands or modes.
  * Offers the option to save the report to a file.

**Note:** You may need to adapt the default band and mode mappings within the Python script (`SPIDERWEB_BAND_MAP` and `SPIDERWEB_MODE_MAP`) if your Dxspider configuration uses different names or definitions.

### Configuration  

In the path `spiderweb/cfg/` rename `config.json.template` in `config.json`:
```console
foo@bar:~$ mv config.json.template config.json
```
then edit it and set the user and password of your database, the menu items, and other stuffs (callsign, mail address...).
There is also a specific parameter, named "enable_cq_filter" used to enable the CQ Zone filtering.

Othewhise, if you prefer, you could use a utility to edit your configuration and menu. Go in "script" folder and run ./config.sh

```console
foo@bar:~$ cd scripts
foo@bar:~$ ./config.sh

*** DxSpider configuration ***
Configuration file loaded from: ../cfg/config.json

   h:  help
   vc: view config.
   ec: edit config.
   vm: view menu
   em: edit menu
   s:  save
   t:  load config. from template

   x:  exit

Make your choice: 

```

**Telnet** (for the list of connected users/nodes)

With other necessary settings set up your spiderweb *telnet_user* Callsign and *telnet_password* in /cfg/config.json
```console
"telnet_host": "mysite",  
"telnet_port": "7300",  
"telnet_user": "myuser_call",  
"telnet_password": "myuser_call_password"  
```   
Restart of the spiderweb application is needed for the changes to take effect.  

**For a user to be assigned a password**, the SYSOP needs to use the command bellow **on the DX Spider Cluster**.   
Password is not propagated across the network for security reasons. Use the command without brackets with a strong password e.g. SET/PASSWORD AB1CD 1234  
```console
SET/PASSWORD <myuser_call> <myuser_call_password>
```  
If we isolate our spiderweb user it will be able to connect to Node but it will not broadcast anything to the network, neither PC92 nor spots or ann. Everything will stay on our node and it will show up as a connected user. Use the command without brackets e.g. SET/ISOLATE AB1CD  

```console
SET/ISOLATE <myuser_call>
```

Maybe on this occasion we set up some basic user data with SPOOF command. This command allows SYSOP to pretend that you are doing the command as the user you specify. Use your own information for "myuser_call" e.g. SPOOF AB1CD SET/NAME Spiderweb  
```console
SPOOF <myuser_call> SET/NAME Spiderweb  
SPOOF <myuser_call> SET/QTH Cerkno  
SPOOF <myuser_call> SET/QRA JN66XD  
SPOOF <myuser_call> SET/HOME S50CLX  
```

If for some reason the password for the spiderweb user on the DX Cluster Node needs to be changed, do so with the command:  
```console
SPOOF <myuser_call> SET/PASSWORD  
```
To change the password you must enter old and a new password.  
```console
Enter old password: 
Enter new password:  
Re-enter new password:  
Password changed  
```

### Crontab
Starting from version 2.4, since all activities are managed by the application, you don't need to schedule anything.


### Run test
Now, you can run your web application with the following command:
```console
foo@bar:~$ python3 webapp.py
```
The flask default port is 5000, so you can see your web app, typing `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.
Keep in mind that the flask web server, usually is used as a test server.

### Production
There are some ways to use it in production. 

My configuration is:
Cloudflare + Nginx + Bjoern

**Bjoern is a lightweight WSGI for python.**

for installing it: 
```console
foo@bar:~$ sudo apt install libev-dev libevdev2
foo@bar:~$ pip3 install bjoern
```

If you want you can make it as a _daemon service_.
Create and edit a file named for example spiderweb.service (in the systemd folder)

```console
foo@bar:~$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/spiderweb.service
```
Below an example of configuration, keep in mind that it is just an example (you have to put your data for your application [here a little guide](https://linuxhandbook.com/create-systemd-services/)   ):
```console
[Unit]
Description=bjoern instance spiderweb
After=network.target
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
User=web
Group=www-data
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/home/web/spiderweb
Environment="PATH=/home/web/spiderweb"
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/web/spiderweb/wsgi.py

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then you can install and start the daemon:
```console
foo@bar:~$ sudo systemctl enable spiderweb.service
foo@bar:~$ sudo systemctl start spiderweb.service
foo@bar:~$ sudo systemctl status spiderweb.service

‚óè spiderweb.service - bjoern instance spiderweb
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/spiderweb.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Sun 2020-10-25 09:56:35 UTC; 8h ago
 Main PID: 6518 (python3)
    Tasks: 1 (limit: 420)
   CGroup: /system.slice/spiderweb.service
           ‚îî‚îÄ6518 /usr/bin/python3 /home/web/spiderweb/wsgi.py

Oct 25 09:56:35 dxcluster01 systemd[1]: Started bjoern instance spiderweb.
```
Now you can install and configure **NGINX**

Install with:  
```console
foo@bar:~$ sudo apt install nginx
```

Configure:
```console
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp
```

```console
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name iu1bow.it www.iu1bow.it;
    location ^~ /.well-known/ {
      alias /home/web/verify/.well-known/;
    }

    location / {
        ssi off;
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}

```

For SSL, I'm using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). This is a free service that allow you to use https and a proxy cache. 


**Search engine indexing:** when you are on-line, if you would to index your website on search engines, you have to generate a file named sitemap.xml and put it in /static/ folder. There are many tools to generate sitemap.xml, for example [www.xml-sitemaps.com](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/)

**Index on MySQL:** if you would to increase speed on callsign search, you could define some index on the table 'spot'. You can see more details on ["create_mysql_index.sql"](scripts/create_mysql_index.sql)


### Mobile
This application is designed for desktop and mobile phone. It is a [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app), so it could be installed and used like an app on mobile.

### API
**Spot list**

You can retrieve last spots calling "**/spotlist**"; For example  [www.iu1bow.it/spotlist](https://www.iu1bow.it/spotlist)

**Country of a callsign**

You can retrive some information about a callsign with **callsign**; for example:  [www.iu1bow.it/callsign?c=IU1BOW](https://www.iu1bow.it/callsign?c=IU1BOW)

**Application description**

The main **server** application ```webapp.py``` is in the root folder. In this application there are routing to html dynamic templates and serves also back-end API. This is wrapped by ```wsgi.py``` for using with **bjoern** server.

Static files (css, js...) are in ```static``` directory: here there are subdirectories: 
- ```dev```  where you can edit and modify sources
- ```rel```  here there are release files created with the building process and used in production

**Lint**

For lint javascript I use **ESLint**. You can install with ```npm init @eslint/config```
 pylint        ```pip install pylint```

**Building process**
