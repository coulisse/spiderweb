# GitHub Actions Workflow - Automatic Release Creation
#
# This workflow is triggered on every push to the "master" branch.
# It performs the following actions:
# . Checks out the repository.
# . Extracts the changelog for the latest release.
# . Reads the version from the cfg/version.txt file.
# . Creates a new GitHub release using softprops/action-gh-release.
#
# Ensure that the correct GitHub token is available in secrets.
